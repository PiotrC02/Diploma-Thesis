Design of the LED Lighting Management and Control System.
The aim of this project is to develop and implement a system that allows for the control of LED lighting. The setup will include a microcontroller connected to a wireless communication module and light-emitting diodes. Information about the lighting status will be transmitted in real-time. The entire system will be controlled via an Android mobile application, which will graphically display the lighting control options. The project aims to demonstrate the basic requirements for a prototype lighting system in a smart home.
